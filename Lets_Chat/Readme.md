# Flask Based Chat Application

<b> Project Name :- </b> Let's Chat

<b> Aim :- </b>  To develop a chat application using FLASK Framework

<b> Project's Demo URL :- </b> http://omkarbs23.pythonanywhere.com/lets_chat/

Description :- This project is a web application that uses Flask framework, which is a popular Python web framework, and SQL as its backend for data storage. The deployment of the application is accomplished with the help of Flask, Jinja templating, HTML, and CSS. Flask is used to handle the server-side logic of the application, while Jinja templating is used for rendering dynamic content on the client-side. HTML and CSS are used for creating the user interface of the application.

<b> NOTE :- </b> The web pages with HTML/CSS were created with the assistance of third-party applications, as the primary objective was to showcase the functionality of the FLASK Framework, rather than to display proficiency in web development.
